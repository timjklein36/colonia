# General
I think it would makes sense to start out with a general class structure that would allow for specific differentiation between varying organisms. At the initial stages of development, however, I am going to stick with a simple hierarchy: <code>Organism (Abstract) > *General Category* (Abstract, 'Insect' for example) > *Species* ('Ant' for example)</code>. This could evolve to account for all [differentiating](#footnotes)<sup>1</sup> subclasses in between.

[1] *differentiating* - necessitates the creation of a subclass in order to provide some unique functionality/attributes
